The Mushrooms box is **realy easy to use**, juste water the box each week, the plan grow up and after few week it’s time to lunch ! 
**>«Our mission is to make food personal again through the passionate development of tools that educate and inspire one family at a time.»**
**Nikhil Arora and Alejandro Velez** got the idea to** grow Mushrooms just in coffee ground**. The idea came when they understood what is in our soils, during a lesson in Berkley’s business school in California.
They made the first test on a bucket in their kitchen. And quickly** they had a demand from restaurants** but their production was very small and slow. 
**They created employment and united a community,**  helping Nikhil Arora and Alejandro Velez to realize their project. At the beginning there were 2 employees and** today there are 213 and 32 partners**, who give the coffee grounds. 
**They were inspired by the idea of recycling waste, into fresh and local food.**
They surf on homemade trend: have local fresh product and less waste. And since them they have won 35 awards with this product and other innovations.
